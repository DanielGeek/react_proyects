# ‚öõÔ∏è DanielGeek's React & Next.js Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of React and Next.js applications. This repository includes a wide variety of frontend and full-stack projects built with modern technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, Firebase, GraphQL, and even blockchain integrations.

The goal of this repository is to showcase real-world use cases, reusable patterns, and hands-on experience in building scalable, testable, and user-friendly applications.
